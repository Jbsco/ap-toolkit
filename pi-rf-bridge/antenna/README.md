# Antenna Design

Physical antenna system for directional RF communication.

## Contents
- `mechanical/` - 3D models and mounting hardware
- `rf_design/` - Impedance matching and RF simulations  
- `test_data/` - Field measurements and antenna patterns

## Goals
- Dual-band 2.4/5GHz Yagi antenna
- 10+ dBi gain with MMCX connectors
- CEM40EC mount integration
- 2-4ft coax with proper impedance matching
- Size/weight compatible with 2306 BLDC motor control
- Compact design for FPV-scale motor torque limits
- Center feed design for balanced mechanical layout
