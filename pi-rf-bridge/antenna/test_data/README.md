# Test Data

Field measurements and antenna characterization.

## Contents
- Antenna pattern measurements
- RSSI vs distance plots
- VSWR and impedance data
- Smith chart analysis
- Performance comparison data

## Test Equipment
- NanoVNA for impedance and S-parameter analysis
- TinySA spectrum analyzer for RF characterization
- SDR (RTLSDR, Airspy HF+) for signal analysis
- Siglent 1204X-E oscilloscope for time domain measurements

## Goals
- Validate design predictions with numerical calculations
- Characterize real-world performance
- Optimize tracking algorithms with measured data
- Document formulas and cite relevant papers
- Maintain data quality for critical analysis
